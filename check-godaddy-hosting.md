# How to Check Your GoDaddy Hosting Type

## Step 1: Log into GoDaddy Account
1. Go to https://godaddy.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to "My Products"

## Step 2: Identify Your Hosting Type

### If you see "Web Hosting" or "cPanel Hosting":
- This is **Shared Hosting**
- ❌ Cannot run Node.js applications
- ✅ Use the Vercel deployment option instead

### If you see "VPS" or "Virtual Private Server":
- This is **VPS Hosting**
- ✅ Can run Node.js applications
- ✅ Full deployment possible
- You should have SSH access details

### If you see "Dedicated Server":
- This is **Dedicated Hosting**
- ✅ Can run Node.js applications
- ✅ Full deployment possible
- You should have root access

### If you see "WordPress Hosting":
- This is **Managed WordPress**
- ❌ Cannot run Node.js applications
- ✅ Use the Vercel deployment option

## Step 3: Find Your Server Access Details

### For VPS/Dedicated:
1. Click on your server product
2. Look for "Manage" or "Dashboard"
3. Find:
   - **IP Address**: (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
   - **SSH Username**: (often "root" or custom)
   - **SSH Port**: (usually 22)
   - **Password**: (set during setup)

### For Shared/cPanel:
1. You'll only have FTP/cPanel access
2. No SSH access available
3. Use Vercel deployment instead

## What to Do Next

### Option A: If you have VPS/Dedicated
Tell me:
1. Your server IP address
2. SSH username
3. Operating system (usually Ubuntu or CentOS)

I'll create a custom deployment script for you.

### Option B: If you have Shared/WordPress Hosting
The Vercel deployment we prepared earlier is your best option:
1. Deploy app to Vercel (free)
2. Point newna.ai domain to Vercel
3. Use Cloudflare tunnel for Ollama

## Quick Test

Try to SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh your-username@your-server-ip
```

If this works, you have VPS/Dedicated hosting.
If it fails or you don't have credentials, you likely have shared hosting.
